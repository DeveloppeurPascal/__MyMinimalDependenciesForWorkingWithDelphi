# Minimal dependencies install for working with Delphi on my projects

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

This project enables me to repatriate, in a single operation, the components and libraries I use regularly and need on any new Windows development machine (virtual or otherwise) to work with Delphi or RAD Studio.

All that's left to do then is install the necessary components, libraries and extensions in the IDE, and modify any default search paths for units that don't need to be hard-linked in projects (although I prefer tree links local to each project, and install components separately to limit configuration changes depending on which versions of Delphi are installed on the same computer).

You can use this basic project for your own installations by making a fork or copy and then customizing it to suit your needs or simply taking inspiration from how it works.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

Please note that I mainly work with the latest version of Delphi, C++Builder or RAD Studio. Depending on your version, some of the submodules included here may not be compatible, or I may remove some that you would need in your version. Check the [releases](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/__MyMinimalDependenciesForWorkingWithDelphi/releases) section of the code repository to go back to an earlier version if necessary.

If you work on websites you can also use my [other minimal install repository for web projects in PHP](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/__MyMinimalDependenciesForWorkingWithPHP).

## Install

To download this project you better should use "git" command but you also can download a ZIP from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/__MyMinimalDependenciesForWorkingWithDelphi).

This project uses submodules. If you downloaded a ZIP or didn't installed it recursively, you should use this commands on its folder :

```bash
git submodule init
```

After initializing the modules or if you want to update a current install, use this command :

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```
