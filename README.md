# Minimal dependencies install for working with Delphi on my projects

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

This project enables me to repatriate, in a single operation, the components and libraries I use regularly and need on any new Windows development machine (virtual or otherwise) to work with Delphi or RAD Studio.

All that's left to do then is install the necessary components, libraries and extensions in the IDE, and modify any default search paths for units that don't need to be hard-linked in projects (although I prefer tree links local to each project, and install components separately to limit configuration changes depending on which versions of Delphi are installed on the same computer).

If you work on websites you can also use my [other minimal install repository for web projects in PHP](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/__MyMinimalDependenciesForWorkingWithPHP).

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/__MyMinimalDependenciesForWorkingWithDelphi).

Download or copy the file "install-sub-repositories.bat" in the folder where you want to install my projects tree and execute it. “Git” must be accessible in your computer's default path.

The file "install-private-repositories.bat" won't work for you. It's about my private projects.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/__MyMinimalDependenciesForWorkingWithDelphi/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
